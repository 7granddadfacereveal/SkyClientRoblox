    <h2>Hello there.</h2>
  <b>Sky client is no longer being maintained.</b>
    <h2>Lets talk about it.</h2>
    <b>Sky clent was one of the many scripts I actually took seriously</b>
    <br>
    <b>With over 3k-2k people using it</b>
    <br>
    <br><b>It was once uploaded by my friend <i>epicfiedten</i> or now called <i>abondanded</i></b>
    <h2>What about this?</h2>
    <b>Sky client, was an script for skywars, I saw nobody really had created an script for it so I decided, why not make an script for it?</b>
    <br>
    <b>Now for the time, I owned it, alot of people used it and was I proud.</b>
    <br>
    <h2>The trouble</h2>
    <b>There, it began, the troubling, my script was successful until, I completely dont know whether I should continue this good script that over 2k people have used.</b>
    <br>
    <b>Alot of scripts I have made, never reached that amount, I actually accidentally found someone using it, I was proud people were using it, considering how bad it is.</b>
    <br>
    <b>There, I decided to take the other path, and not continue sky client</b>
    <h2>How did I create skyclient?</h2>
    <b>Sky client was inspired off of</b> <a href="https://github.com/7GrandDadPGN/VapeV4ForRoblox">Vape V4</a> <b>by 7GrandDadPGN.</b>
    <br>
    <b>The UI was inspired by it too!</b>
    <br>
    <b>You can use skyclient here: </b>
